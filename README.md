# Momentum Chess 
This is a university project, where the initial idea was to develop a Chess game where depending on the current state of the game, or momentum(thats where the game name comes from), we change the enviroment lightning and soundtrack of the game to try to provide different emotions on the the situation.
In the end there is nothing too especial about the enviroment changes since we had a limited amount of time to develop ideas and actually develop the game.
The game is entirely made with the unity engine.
